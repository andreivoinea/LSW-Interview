-------------
 Move with W A S D or the Arrow Keys around the map
 Press I to open the inventory tab The inventory functions simmilar to the Minecraft Inventory System. Users can click and drop items in the avalabile slots.

Users can stack multiple items of the same type in the same slot, as long as it dosen’t exceed the specific item’s maximum stack number.

The player can choose if he wants to sell to or buy from the shopkeeper at any time in the interface using the right side buttons. The player can input (using the inventory mechanics from above) items into the Trading Slots, and depending on their initial selection Buy Or Sell items using the Confirm Items button (located under the Buy/Sell buttons).

Implementation:
-------------
After reading the task description, I decided the concept of the game : A pixelated game, where one can farm items using tools (shovel for gardening, axe for foraging) and sell them to vendors for gold. Then gold can be traded in to other vendors for cosmetics.
I created a to do list and I started working on the project:
To do List:
1. Create basic character functinality: moving and interacting
2. Implement character UI : inventory panel, items, outfit, currency
3. Create shopkeeper and functionality : shop inventory, buy and sell items.
4. Implement character UI functionality : equipping items and make them visible
5. Add design and aestethics for the game
6. Add design and aestethics for the Character
7. Create UI menus
8. Add design and aestethics for the UI
9. Implement character animations
I started writing lines of code and bigger reusable systems, I tested and improved them and moved on. Difficulties started arising when working on the UI design of the game. Working only as backend in my previous jobs meant there was always somebody else handling the UI and artwork, and it took a fair bit of time getting accoustomed to making them by myself.
I made the artwork for the game during the interview process and didn’t copy any line of code from other projects.

Future Prospects for the project:
-------------
• Improvemets on UI and aesthetics.
• Tutorial system
• Character and background animations
• Ability to use tools on environment for farming gold
• Storage System
• More Items
• Player Stats and Player Level
• Story Line and Main Player Purpose
